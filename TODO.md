- Implement ways to toggle AI on and off in the game/GUI (right now its by default always on)
- Remove fixed seed
- Implement proper score and line tracking
- Implement levels (certain amount of lines -> level up -> faster falling shit)
- Implement next pieces preview (game already tracks next pieces, just need to display in gui)
- Make Title, Pause, Game over screens look better
- Honestly just make anything in the gui look better
- Maybe add color to the terminal version?
